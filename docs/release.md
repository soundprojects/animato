# Release Process

This checklist is for v1.0.0 and later stable releases.

## Preflight

1. Confirm `CHANGELOG.md` has the new version entry.
2. Confirm workspace version and internal dependency pins match the tag.
3. Run the full test plan in [testing.md](./testing.md).
4. Run `cargo publish --dry-run` for each crate immediately before publishing
   it. In a coordinated workspace release, downstream crates cannot verify
   against crates.io until their new internal dependencies have been published.
5. Capture benchmark baseline data from [benchmarks.md](./benchmarks.md).

## Publish Order

```text
animato-core
animato-color
animato-tween
animato-spring
animato-path
animato-physics
animato-driver
animato-timeline
animato-gpu
animato-wasm
animato-bevy
animato-leptos
animato-dioxus
animato-yew
animato-devtools
animato-js
animato
```

## Tag

```sh
git tag v1.6.0
git push origin v1.6.0
```

The publish workflow validates that `v1.6.0` matches the workspace package
version `1.6.0`.

The NPM publish workflow also validates the tag, builds `@aarambhdevhub/animato-core`, checks
the package size budget, skips already-published versions, and publishes with
`NPM_TOKEN`.

## GitHub Release

GitHub release bodies are stored under `.github/release-notes/` and consumed
by `.github/workflows/publish.yml` through `body_path`.

The release notes must include:

- crate table with versions,
- install snippet,
- docs links,
- benchmark summary,
- coverage and fuzz gate status,
- JavaScript/WASM package gate status,
- notable compatibility notes.
